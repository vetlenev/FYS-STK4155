This repository contains code for analyzing the fitting potential of regression methods on the FrakeFunction, using polynomial features.

The structure of the repository is as follows:
- A report as HTML-file containing the main implementation and results of the project.
- A Jupyter Notebook containing all code used to obtain the results.
- A folder ```figs``` containing all figures and plots from our results.
- A ```.tif``` file for the topographic landscape used in Exercise 6.
